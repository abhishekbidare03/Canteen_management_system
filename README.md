# Canteen_management_system

## Project Overview

Canteen Management System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline food ordering and management in a canteen environment. The platform supports multiple user roles, including employees, chefs, and administrators, enabling seamless menu browsing, order placement, kitchen management, and administrative oversight. The system aims to digitize and simplify the canteen experience for both staff and users.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React framework), CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- **Backend:** Node.js (API routes in Next.js)
- **Database:** (Specify if you use one, e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite)
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Other:** Modern JavaScript (ES6+), Vercel for deployment

## UI Design Inspiration

The UI draws inspiration from modern, clean, and user-friendly food ordering platforms. The design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and a visually engaging experience, with floating icons and vibrant imagery to create a lively canteen atmosphere. The interface is inspired by popular food delivery apps and incorporates custom illustrations and screenshots to showcase key features.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the application can be found in the `Screenshots` folder included in this repository.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
